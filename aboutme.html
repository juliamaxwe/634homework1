    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to My Basic HTML Page!</h2>
    <p>My name is Julia, and I'm a 24-year-old student from Philadelphia. I've also lived in Ohio, Pittsburgh, and most recently, New York City. </p>
    <p>I am really interested in merging my creative pursuits with my academic and technical ones, and hope that my MSI degree will help me continue to do that!</p>
